# -Hydrophonics---Monitoring-and-Balance-by-detection
# -Introduction-

The main purpse of this project is to make a self balanced home and office hydrophonics system, which need one asssembly, one coding and then it's ready to GO!

The system abilities are monitoring EC, Temprature and pH of hydrophonics system and using our peristaltic pumps which connects the balancing solutions to the water tank and what's will keep it in values range that we selected according to our plants.

This project is about making your growing hydrophonics much easier!

!!!*There is currently a problem with the pH sensor, it is unable to be calibrated. After many attempts with different devices from the same model we recommend that you try another model*!!!

# Agri-tech prespection
EC

In hydroponics, an EC measurement can be used as an indicator of how many dissolved salts are present, and thus the corresponding strength of a nutrient solution. The most common conductivity meter used in hydroponics is the two-pole sensor. This technology offers a limited range but is relatively inexpensive.

For most plants you want the EC measurement to be hitting between 1.2-1.6 during the vegetative stage and 1.6-2.4 during flowering, but this can be dependent on the type of plant that's growing.
