# Hydroponics Monitoring and Balance by detection
# Introduction

The main purpse of this project is to make a self balanced home and office hydroponics system, which need one asssembly, one coding and then it's ready to GO!

The system abilities are monitoring EC, Temprature and pH of hydroponics system and using our peristaltic pumps which connects the balancing solutions to the water tank and what's will keep it in values range that we selected according to our plants.

This project is about making your growing hydroponics much easier!

!!!*There is currently a problem with the pH sensor, it is unable to be calibrated. After many attempts with different devices from the same model we recommend that you try another model*!!!
