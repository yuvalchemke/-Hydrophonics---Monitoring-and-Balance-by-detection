In the next three graphs you can see an example to the values in each sensor

<ins>Monitoring pumps</ins>

In the next three graphs represents what is the current status of every pump and you can also see if it worked recently.

The number 0 represent that the pump is not in activ, and the number 1 represent that the pump is in activ or worked (according to the time that you looking at).
In our case we decided that when a pump is turned on it will work for 8 seconds (you can change the time for each pump in the code according to your needs) and then turn off until the next need in balance.

For example you can see in the PPM value graph that represend the EC that in **:** the measurement was *** . and there for, you can also see on the EC pump gragh that he work in **:** for 8 seconds in order to balance the solutain in the water tank. You can see that the pump kept working every 20 minutes until the solutain was between the correct values
